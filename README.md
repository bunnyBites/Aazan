# Aazan
Aazan is a full-stack Rust web app that uses a "learning by teaching" model. Users teach topics to an AI student, Bodhi, via text, PDF, or voice chat. This monolithic application is built with Axum and Dioxus from a single codebase. The name Aazan is derived from the Tamil word for "teacher" and the Hindi word for "easy."
